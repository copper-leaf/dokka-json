 * A `CommentComponent` is a rich chunk of text parsed from a code comment.

 * The full text for inline comments can be created by joining together a list of CommentComponents on their `text`.
 * Normal text should have a kind of `text`, and the `text` of the component is just the text as entered in the
 * comment. Sections of text that link to another code element have a kind of `link`, the `value` is an identifier
 * pointing to the element being referenced, and `text` is the text that should be displayed.
